# One-STI-App-Mod-V.1.0
For Educational Purposes Only.  

One STI App on default hides your grade records if you have unsettled balance, **the point of this project is to reverse engineer it and create a modified version showing your grade records even with unsettled balance.** This is for educational purposes only and does not encourage everyone to use it.
